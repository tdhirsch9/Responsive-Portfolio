            <p>
                I've been interested in programming and code for awhile now, but I've never taken much time to learn. I had made a few attempts to learn on my own in the past but it did not last too long. I'm looking forward to going through this class and actually having a solid understanding of web development. On a side note, penguins are my favorite animal, hence the picture.

                I have lived in Colorado the last few years after moving here from Virginia and I currently work at a law firm.
